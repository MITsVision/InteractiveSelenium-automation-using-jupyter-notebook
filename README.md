Web/UI automation using selenium in Jupyter environment.

Automated testing is one of the essential and tedious part of software development cycle. Developing the automated test script using any porgraming languages / framework is easy but always debuging it is the most difficult part. In the python community, selenium is one of the most popular framework used for test automation. Developing automation test script using selenium is kinda time consuming, sometime it becomes very frustrateting because one failure leads to run, debug and analyze the flow from start.

Jupyter notebook is most popular package which widly adopted in data science community because of it's interactive nature, bringing this for developing automatated test script will make life of automation engineers fairly easy. Automation using selenium lacks the interaction with browser while developing it, you can only see the output of the script after completly developing it {output can not be verified every next step while developing}. I propose a very interactive method for developing automated test script, scripts can be verified while developing it. Combined uses of jupyter notebook and selenium will enable to develop test script on real time. Selenium driver will be available for interaction in the jupyter environment which will enables developer to find the xpaths of the elements and then perform the actions simultaneously.
